# Python Portfolio Projects

This folder contains a collection of Python projects Iâ€™ve completed to demonstrate data cleaning, analysis, and visualization skills.  
Each project is based on real-world datasets and highlights specific Python techniques such as data wrangling with pandas, exploratory analysis, visualization, and storytelling in Jupyter notebooks.

## ðŸ“Ž About
This repo is a portfolio showcase of my Python data analysis skills, demonstrating:  
- Cleaning messy, real-world datasets  
- Wrangling and transforming data with pandas  
- Exploring trends through visualizations  
- Communicating insights for both technical and non-technical audiences

## ðŸ“‚ Projects

### ðŸ”¹ [Mobile App Market Analysis: Google Play vs. App Store](./mobile-app-analysis)
**Dataset Sources:**  
- [Google Play Store Apps Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lava18/google-play-store-apps)  
- [Apple App Store Apps Dataset (Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps)  

**Description:**  
Cleaned and compared datasets from Google Play and the Apple App Store to identify cross-platform app trends.  
Explored ratings, engagement, and categories to recommend app genres with strong potential on both markets.  

**Skills Highlighted:**  
- Data cleaning and transformation in **pandas**  
- Exploratory data analysis with **Jupyter**  
- Visualization with **matplotlib / seaborn**  
- Cross-dataset normalization and comparison  

**Key Findings:**  
- Genres like *Social*, *Games*, *Travel*, and Photography**Â maintain steady popularity across both stores.
- However, *Travel* is a less saturated genre, so it may offer developers a better chance to introduce an app that is popular in both markets.
